Master Reverse Engineering Cheat Sheet for the CPENT and TryHackMe. It follows the exact logical flow from opening a file to extracting the flag.
Phase 1: The "Quick Look" (Before GDB)
Always try the easiest tools first to save time.

    strings [file]: Find plain-text passwords or flags hidden in the binary.
    ltrace ./[file] [password]: Intercepts library calls. If it uses strcmp, it will show: strcmp("secret", "your_input").
    file [file]: Check if it is 32-bit (uses EAX/ESP) or 64-bit (uses RAX/RSP/RDI/RSI).

Phase 2: The "Map" (Ghidra)
Use this to understand the "Logic" and find addresses.

    New Project 

Import File
Double-click Green Dragon.
Analyze (Yes)

    Find main in the Symbol Tree.
    Identify the "Decision":
        Look for if statements or strcmp.
        Find the Hex Address in the "Listing" window (e.g., 0x08048665).
        Note if it's a Generator (builds a flag and prints it) or a Comparator (checks your input).

Phase 3: The "Operation" (GDB)
Use this to extract data or bypass checks while the program runs.
Step 1: The Setup (Engine Off)

    gdb ./[file]: Load the file.
    info functions: List all functions (look for main, giveFlag, or secret).
    disassemble main: View the assembly code to find the "Decision" point (cmp).

Step 2: The Trap (Setting Breakpoints)

    break *[address]: Set a breakpoint at the comparison.
        Example: break *0x08048665 (Stop before the cmp).
    break puts: Best for "Flag Generators" to catch the flag right before it prints.

Step 3: The Start (Engine On)

    run [password]: Use this if the program takes arguments.
    run: Use this if the program asks "Enter input:" (Interactive).

Step 4: The Extraction (Paused at Breakpoint)

    i r (Info Registers): See the "buckets" of data.
    x/s $rdi (64-bit): Examine the 1st argument as a string (The Secret).
    x/s $rsi (64-bit): Examine the 2nd argument as a string (Your Input).
    x/s *(void**)$esp (32-bit): Examine the string on the stack.

Step 5: The Cheat (Modifying Logic)

    set $eax = [value]: Change the register to match the secret.
        Example: set $eax = 0x7a69 (Bypasses the "Access Denied" check).
    c (Continue): Resume running to see the "Success" message.

Phase 4: Common Terms Reference

    ASCII: Number-to-Letter map (e.g., 0x41 = A).
    CMP: The "Decision." Sets flags based on the difference between two values.
    JNE / JE: The "Branch." Jumps to different code blocks based on the CMP result.
    ATOI: Text-to-Number converter (turns "123" into 123).
    RET: The "Exit." Finishes the function.

Summary Table: 32-bit vs 64-bit GDB
Feature	32-bit (x86)	64-bit (x64)
Registers	EAX, EBX, ECX, ESP	RAX, RBX, RCX, RSP, RDI, RSI
Arguments	On the Stack ($esp)	In Registers ($rdi, $rsi)
Breakpoints	Addresses like 0x0804...	Addresses like 0x0040...
